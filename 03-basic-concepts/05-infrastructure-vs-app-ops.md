## Infrastructure Ops vs. Application Ops

Operations can be divided into the two sections.

### 1. Infrastructure Operations

Operations regarding the hardware and the underlying infrastructure to run workloads, e.g. geo-replication, database backups, key-rotations.

### 2. Application Operations

Operations regarding the deployed application, such as deploying new releases, ensure zero-downtime deployments, change configurations at runtime.
